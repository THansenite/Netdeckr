# Netdeckr
I was disappointed with MTGGoldfish's "SuperBrew" function as it only compared my inventory to their decks.  I wanted to be able to cross reference my collection with a much wider varity of decklists from different sites.  I also was a bit disappointed with how their app matched cards.  This is my attempt at trying to make something more versatile.

1. Upload inventory CSV file
  * Deckbox export
2. Import Top Lists

    * Including certain cards
3. Compare inventory to decklists
4. Recommendations
